# 🏭 Pydantic AI Agent Factory - Global Orchestration Rules

This defines the complete orchestration workflow for the AI Agent Factory system and the principles that apply to ALL Pydantic AI agent development work. When a user requests to build an AI agent, follow this systematic process using specialized subagents to transform high-level requirements into simple but complete Pydantic AI agents.

**Core Philosophy**: Transform "I want an agent that can search the web" into a fully-functional and tested Pydantic AI agent. User input is required during Phase 0 clarification, then the process runs autonomously.

---

## 🎯 Primary Directive

⚠️ **CRITICAL WORKFLOW TRIGGER**: When ANY user request involves creating, building, or developing an AI agent:

1. **IMMEDIATELY** recognize this as an agent factory request (stop everything else)
2. **MUST** follow Phase 0 first - ask clarifying questions
3. **WAIT** for user responses
4. **THEN** check Archon and proceed with workflow

**Factory Workflow Recognition Patterns** (if user says ANY of these):
- "Build an AI agent that..."
- "Create an agent for..."  
- "I need an AI assistant that can..."
- "Make a Pydantic AI agent..."
- "I want to build a Pydantic AI agent..."
- Any request mentioning agent/AI/LLM + functionality

**MANDATORY Archon Integration (happens AFTER Phase 0):**
1. After getting user clarifications, run `mcp__archon__health_check`
2. If Archon is available:
   - **CREATE** an Archon project for the agent being built
   - **CREATE** tasks in Archon for each workflow phase:
     - Task 1: "Requirements Analysis" (Phase 1 - pydantic-ai-planner)
     - Task 2: "System Prompt Design" (Phase 2A - pydantic-ai-prompt-engineer)
     - Task 3: "Tool Development Planning" (Phase 2B - pydantic-ai-tool-integrator)
     - Task 4: "Dependency Configuration" (Phase 2C - pydantic-ai-dependency-manager)
     - Task 5: "Agent Implementation" (Phase 3 - main Claude Code)
     - Task 6: "Validation & Testing" (Phase 4 - pydantic-ai-validator)
     - Task 7: "Documentation & Delivery" (Phase 5 - main Claude Code)
   - **UPDATE** each task status as you progress:
     - Mark as "doing" when starting the phase
     - Mark as "done" when phase completes successfully
     - Add notes about any issues or deviations
   - **USE** Archon's RAG during implementation for documentation lookup
   - **INSTRUCT** all subagents to reference the Archon project ID
3. If Archon is not available: Proceed without it but use TodoWrite for local tracking

**WORKFLOW ENFORCEMENT**: You MUST:
1. Start with Phase 0 (clarifying questions)
2. Wait for user response before proceeding
3. Then systematically progress through ALL phases
4. Never jump directly to implementation

When you want to use or call upon a subagent, you must invoke the subagent, giving them a prompt and passing control to them.

---

## 🔄 Complete Factory Workflow

### Phase 0: Request Recognition & Clarification
**Trigger Patterns** (activate factory on any of these):
- "Build an AI agent that..."
- "Create an agent for..."
- "I need an AI assistant that can..."
- "Make a Pydantic AI agent..."
- "Develop an LLM agent..."
- Any request mentioning agent/AI/LLM + functionality

**Immediate Action**:
```
1. Acknowledge agent creation request
2. Ask 2-3 targeted clarifying questions (BEFORE invoking planner):
   - Primary functionality and use case
   - Preferred APIs or integrations (if applicable)
   - Output format preferences
3. ⚠️ CRITICAL: STOP AND WAIT for user responses
   - Wait to proceed to step 4 until user has answered
   - Refrain from making assumptions to "keep the process moving"
   - Avoid creating folders or invoke subagents yet
   - WAIT for explicit user input before continuing
4. Only after user responds: DETERMINE AGENT FOLDER NAME (snake_case, e.g., web_search_agent, asana_manager)
5. Create agents/[AGENT_FOLDER_NAME]/ directory
6. Invoke ALL subagents with the EXACT SAME folder name
7. Tell each subagent: "Output to agents/[AGENT_FOLDER_NAME]/"
```

### Phase 1: Requirements Documentation 🎯
**Subagent**: `pydantic-ai-planner`
**Trigger**: Invoked after Phase 0 clarifications collected
**Mode**: AUTONOMOUS - Works without user interaction
**Philosophy**: SIMPLE, FOCUSED requirements - MVP mindset
**Archon**: Update Task 1 to "doing" before invoking subagent

```
Actions:
1. Update Archon Task 1 "Requirements Analysis" to status="doing"
2. Receive user request + clarifications + FOLDER NAME + Archon project ID from main agent
3. Analyze requirements focusing on CORE functionality only
4. Make simple, practical assumptions (single model, basic error handling)
5. Create minimal INITIAL.md with 2-3 core features maximum
6. Output: agents/[EXACT_FOLDER_NAME]/planning/INITIAL.md
   ⚠️ CRITICAL: Output to planning/ subdirectory
7. Update Archon Task 1 to status="done" after subagent completes
```

**Quality Gate**: INITIAL.md must include:
- ✅ Agent classification and type
- ✅ Functional requirements
- ✅ Technical requirements
- ✅ External dependencies
- ✅ Success criteria

### Phase 2: Parallel Component Development ⚡
**Execute SIMULTANEOUSLY** (all three subagents work in parallel):
**Archon**: Update Tasks 2, 3, 4 to "doing" before parallel invocation

**CRITICAL: Use parallel tool invocation:** When invoking multiple subagents, you MUST call all three Task tools in a SINGLE message with multiple tool uses. This ensures true parallel execution.
- ❌ WRONG: Invoke planner, wait for completion, then invoke prompt engineer
- ✅ RIGHT: Single message with three Task tool invocations
- Also update all three Archon tasks (2, 3, 4) to "doing" before the parallel invocation

#### 2A: System Prompt Engineering
**Subagent**: `pydantic-ai-prompt-engineer`
**Philosophy**: SIMPLE, CLEAR prompts - typically 100-300 words
```
Input: planning/INITIAL.md + FOLDER NAME from main agent
Output: agents/[EXACT_FOLDER_NAME]/planning/prompts.md
⚠️ CRITICAL: Output MARKDOWN file with prompt specifications, NOT Python code
Contents:
- One simple static system prompt (100-300 words)
- Skip dynamic prompts unless explicitly needed
- Focus on essential behavior only
```

#### 2B: Tool Development Planning
**Subagent**: `pydantic-ai-tool-integrator`
**Philosophy**: MINIMAL tools - 2-3 essential functions only
```
Input: planning/INITIAL.md + FOLDER NAME from main agent
Output: agents/[EXACT_FOLDER_NAME]/planning/tools.md
⚠️ CRITICAL: Output MARKDOWN file with tool specifications, NOT Python code
Contents:
- 2-3 essential tool specifications only
- Simple parameters (1-3 per tool)
- Basic error handling
- Single-purpose tools
```

#### 2C: Dependency Configuration Planning
**Subagent**: `pydantic-ai-dependency-manager`
**Philosophy**: MINIMAL config - essential environment variables only
```
Input: planning/INITIAL.md + FOLDER NAME from main agent
Output: agents/[EXACT_FOLDER_NAME]/planning/dependencies.md
⚠️ CRITICAL: Output MARKDOWN file with dependency specifications, NOT Python code
Contents:
- Essential environment variables only
- Single model provider (no fallbacks)
- Simple dataclass dependencies
- Minimal Python packages
```

**Phase 2 Complete When**: All three subagents report completion

### Phase 3: Agent Implementation 🔨
**Actor**: Main Claude Code (not a subagent)
**Archon**: Update Task 5 to "doing" before starting implementation

```
Actions:
1. Update Archon Task 5 "Agent Implementation" to status="doing"
2. Mark Archon Tasks 2, 3, 4 as "done" (after verifying subagents completed)
3. READ the 4 markdown files from planning phase:
   - agents/[folder]/planning/INITIAL.md
   - agents/[folder]/planning/prompts.md
   - agents/[folder]/planning/tools.md
   - agents/[folder]/planning/dependencies.md
4. Use Archon RAG to search for Pydantic AI patterns and examples as needed
5. IMPLEMENT the actual Python code based on specifications:
   - Convert prompt specs → prompts.py
   - Convert tool specs → tools.py
   - Convert dependency specs → settings.py, providers.py, dependencies.py
6. Create complete agent implementation:
   - Combine all components into agent.py
   - Wire up dependencies and tools
   - Create main execution file
7. Update Archon Task 5 to status="done" when implementation completes
8. Structure final project:
   agents/[agent_name]/
   ├── agent.py           # Main agent
   ├── settings.py        # Configuration
   ├── providers.py       # Model providers
   ├── dependencies.py    # Dependencies
   ├── tools.py          # Tool implementations
   ├── prompts.py        # System prompts
   ├── __init__.py       # Package init
   ├── requirements.txt  # Python deps
   ├── .env.example      # Environment template
   └── README.md         # Usage documentation
```

### Phase 4: Validation & Testing ✅
**Subagent**: `pydantic-ai-validator`
**Trigger**: Automatic after implementation
**Duration**: 3-5 minutes
**Archon**: Update Task 6 to "doing" before invoking validator

```
Actions:
1. Update Archon Task 6 "Validation & Testing" to status="doing"
2. Invoke validator subagent with agent folder and Archon project ID
3. Create comprehensive test suite
4. Validate against INITIAL.md requirements
5. Run tests with TestModel
6. Generate validation report
7. Update Archon Task 6 to status="done" after validation completes
8. Output: agents/[agent_name]/tests/
   ├── test_agent.py
   ├── test_tools.py
   ├── test_integration.py
   ├── test_validation.py
   ├── conftest.py
   └── VALIDATION_REPORT.md
```

**Success Criteria**:
- All requirements validated
- Core functionality tested
- Error handling verified
- Performance acceptable

### Phase 5: Delivery & Documentation 📦
**Actor**: Main Claude Code
**Archon**: Update Task 7 to "doing" before final documentation
**Final Actions**:
```
1. Update Archon Task 7 "Documentation & Delivery" to status="doing"
2. Generate comprehensive README.md
3. Create usage examples
4. Document API endpoints (if applicable)
5. Provide deployment instructions
6. Update Archon Task 7 to status="done"
7. Add final notes to Archon project about agent capabilities
8. Summary report to user with Archon project link
```

## 📋 Archon Task Management Protocol

### Task Creation Flow
When Archon is available, create all workflow tasks immediately after project creation:
```python
# After creating Archon project
tasks = [
    {"title": "Requirements Analysis", "assignee": "pydantic-ai-planner"},
    {"title": "System Prompt Design", "assignee": "pydantic-ai-prompt-engineer"},
    {"title": "Tool Development Planning", "assignee": "pydantic-ai-tool-integrator"},
    {"title": "Dependency Configuration", "assignee": "pydantic-ai-dependency-manager"},
    {"title": "Agent Implementation", "assignee": "Claude Code"},
    {"title": "Validation & Testing", "assignee": "pydantic-ai-validator"},
    {"title": "Documentation & Delivery", "assignee": "Claude Code"}
]
# Create all tasks with status="todo" initially
```

### Task Status Updates
- Set to "doing" immediately before starting each phase
- Set to "done" immediately after phase completes successfully
- Add notes if phase encounters issues or deviations
- Never have multiple tasks in "doing" status (except during parallel Phase 2)

### Subagent Communication
Always pass the Archon project ID to subagents:
- Include in the prompt: "Use Archon Project ID: [project-id]"
- Subagents should reference this in their output for traceability

## 🎭 Subagent Invocation Rules

### Automatic Invocation
Subagents are invoked AUTOMATICALLY based on workflow phase:
```python
if user_request.contains(agent_creation_pattern):
    # Phase 0 - Main Claude Code asks clarifications
    clarifications = ask_user_questions()
    
    # Phase 1 - Invoke planner with context
    invoke("pydantic-ai-planner", context={
        "user_request": original_request,
        "clarifications": clarifications
    })
    
    # Phase 2 - Parallel automatic
    parallel_invoke([
        "pydantic-ai-prompt-engineer",
        "pydantic-ai-tool-integrator", 
        "pydantic-ai-dependency-manager"
    ])
    
    # Phase 3 - Main Claude Code
    implement_agent()
    
    # Phase 4 - Automatic
    invoke("pydantic-ai-validator")
```

### Manual Override
Users can explicitly request specific subagents:
- "Use the planner to refine requirements"
- "Have the tool integrator add web search"
- "Run the validator again"

## 🔧 Implementation Guidelines

### For Simple Agent Requests
Example: "Build an agent that can search the web"
```
1. Planner asks minimal questions (1-2)
2. Assumes standard patterns (Brave API, string output)
3. Completes in ~10 minutes total
4. Delivers working agent with basic tests
```

### For Complex Agent Requests
Example: "Build a multi-modal agent with database, caching, and workflow orchestration"
```
1. Planner asks comprehensive questions (4-5)
2. Multiple iterations may be needed
3. Delivers simple yet complete system with full test coverage
```

### Error Handling Protocol
If any subagent fails:
```
1. Log error with context
2. Attempt automatic recovery
3. If recovery fails, ask user for guidance
4. Continue with partial implementation if possible
5. Document limitations in README
```

---

## 📝 Main Agent Clarification Guidelines

When a user requests an AI agent, the main Claude Code agent should:

### Ask 2-3 Focused Questions
Keep questions simple and targeted:
1. **Core Functionality**: "What specific tasks should this agent handle?"
2. **Integration Needs**: "Will it need to connect to any external services or APIs?"
3. **Output Format**: "Should it return plain text, structured data, or something else?"

### Avoid Over-Questioning
- Don't ask about technical details (the planner will handle those)
- Don't ask about implementation specifics
- Keep questions high-level and user-friendly

### Pass Context to Planner
When invoking the planner, provide:
- Original user request
- User's answers to clarifying questions
- Any additional context from the conversation

## 🚀 Quick Start Examples

### Example 1: Web Search Agent
**User**: "I want to build an AI agent that can search the web"

**Claude Code Response**:
```
I'll help you build a web search AI agent using the Pydantic AI framework. Let me ask a few quick questions to better understand your needs:

1. What will the agent primarily search for? (general web content, specific domains, research papers, etc.)
2. Should the agent summarize the results or return raw search data?
3. Do you have a preference for which search API to use? (Brave, Google, Bing)

[STOPS HERE AND WAITS FOR USER TO RESPOND]

[After user responds with their answers]

Perfect! Based on your requirements [summarize their answers], I'll now invoke our requirements planner to create a comprehensive specification for your web search agent.

### Example 2: Database Query Agent
**User**: "Create an agent that can query PostgreSQL databases and explain results"

**Claude Code Response**:
```
I'll create a PostgreSQL query agent with explanation capabilities. Let me ask a few quick questions first:

1. What types of queries will this agent need to run? (SELECT only, or also INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE?)
2. Should it connect to a specific database or handle multiple database connections?
3. How detailed should the explanations be? (brief summaries or detailed analysis?)

[STOPS HERE AND WAITS FOR USER TO RESPOND]

[After user responds with their answers]

Great! Based on your requirements [summarize their answers], I'll now create a comprehensive requirements document for your PostgreSQL agent.

## 🔄 Pydantic AI Core Principles

**IMPORTANT: These principles apply to ALL Pydantic AI agent development:**

### Research Methodology for AI Agents
- **Web search extensively** - Always research Pydantic AI patterns and best practices
- **Study official documentation** - ai.pydantic.dev is the authoritative source
- **Pattern extraction** - Identify reusable agent architectures and tool patterns
- **Gotcha documentation** - Document async patterns, model limits, and context management issues

## 📚 Project Awareness & Context

- **Use a virtual environment** to run all code and tests. If one isn't already in the codebase when needed, create it
- **Use consistent Pydantic AI naming conventions** and agent structure patterns
- **Follow established agent directory organization** patterns (agent.py, tools.py, models.py)
- **Leverage Pydantic AI examples extensively** - Study existing patterns before creating new agents

## 🧱 Agent Structure & Modularity

- **Never create files longer than 500 lines** - Split into modules when approaching limit
- **Organize agent code into clearly separated modules** grouped by responsibility:
  - `agent.py` - Main agent definition and execution logic
  - `tools.py` - Tool functions used by the agent
  - `models.py` - Pydantic output models and dependency classes
  - `dependencies.py` - Context dependencies and external service integrations
- **Use clear, consistent imports** - Import from pydantic_ai package appropriately
- **Use python-dotenv and load_dotenv()** for environment variables - Follow examples/main_agent_reference/settings.py pattern
- **Never hardcode sensitive information** - Always use .env files for API keys and configuration

## 🤖 Pydantic AI Development Standards

### Agent Creation Patterns
- **Use model-agnostic design** - Support multiple providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini)
- **Implement dependency injection** - Use deps_type for external services and context
- **Define structured outputs** - Use Pydantic models for result validation
- **Include comprehensive system prompts** - Both static and dynamic instructions

### Tool Integration Standards
- **Use @agent.tool decorator** for context-aware tools with RunContext[DepsType]
- **Use @agent.tool_plain decorator** for simple tools without context dependencies
- **Implement proper parameter validation** - Use Pydantic models for tool parameters
- **Handle tool errors gracefully** - Implement retry mechanisms and error recovery

### Environment Variable Configuration with python-dotenv
```python
# Use python-dotenv and pydantic-settings for proper configuration management
from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings
from pydantic import Field, ConfigDict
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from pydantic_ai.providers.openai import OpenAIProvider
from pydantic_ai.models.openai import OpenAIModel

class Settings(BaseSettings):
    """Application settings with environment variable support."""
    
    model_config = ConfigDict(
        env_file=".env",
        env_file_encoding="utf-8",
        case_sensitive=False,
        extra="ignore"
    )
    
    # LLM Configuration
    llm_provider: str = Field(default="openai", description="LLM provider")
    llm_api_key: str = Field(..., description="API key for the LLM provider")
    llm_model: str = Field(default="gpt-4", description="Model name to use")
    llm_base_url: str = Field(
        default="https://api.openai.com/v1", 
        description="Base URL for the LLM API"
    )

def load_settings() -> Settings:
    """Load settings with proper error handling and environment loading."""
    # Load environment variables from .env file
    load_dotenv()
    
    try:
        return Settings()
    except Exception as e:
        error_msg = f"Failed to load settings: {e}"
        if "llm_api_key" in str(e).lower():
            error_msg += "\nMake sure to set LLM_API_KEY in your .env file"
        raise ValueError(error_msg) from e

def get_llm_model():
    """Get configured LLM model with proper environment loading."""
    settings = load_settings()
    provider = OpenAIProvider(
        base_url=settings.llm_base_url, 
        api_key=settings.llm_api_key
    )
    return OpenAIModel(settings.llm_model, provider=provider)
```

### Testing Standards for AI Agents
- **Use TestModel for development** - Fast validation without API calls
- **Use FunctionModel for custom behavior** - Control agent responses in tests
- **Use Agent.override() for testing** - Replace models in test contexts
- **Test both sync and async patterns** - Ensure compatibility with different execution modes
- **Test tool validation** - Verify tool parameter schemas and error handling

## ✅ Task Management for AI Development

- **Break agent development into clear steps** with specific completion criteria
- **Mark tasks complete immediately** after finishing agent implementations
- **Update task status in real-time** as agent development progresses
- **Test agent behavior** before marking implementation tasks complete

## 📎 Pydantic AI Coding Standards

### Agent Architecture
```python
# Follow main_agent_reference patterns - no result_type unless structured output needed
from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext
from dataclasses import dataclass
from .settings import load_settings

@dataclass
class AgentDependencies:
    """Dependencies for agent execution"""
    api_key: str
    session_id: str = None

# Load settings with proper dotenv handling
settings = load_settings()

# Simple agent with string output (default)
agent = Agent(
    get_llm_model(),  # Uses load_settings() internally
    deps_type=AgentDependencies,
    system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant..."
)

@agent.tool
async def example_tool(
    ctx: RunContext[AgentDependencies], 
    query: str
) -> str:
    """Tool with proper context access"""
    return await external_api_call(ctx.deps.api_key, query)
```
