optimisation.

~ Code Quality: Ensure all code follows clean code principles and aligns with the SOLID design principles to
maintain readability, scalability, and maintainability.

- File Size Management: Avoid bloated files â€” keep each file under 500 lines of code by applying modular design
  and separation of concerns.

~ Documentation: Include a comprehensive README.md file with clear instructions on how to install, configure,
and run the project locally to ensure smooth onboarding and setup.
